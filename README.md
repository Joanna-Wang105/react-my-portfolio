# My Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio project! This portfolio showcases my work, skills, and experiences. It's built using **React** for the user interface, **Vite** for fast development and building, and **Bootstrap** for a responsive and modern CSS design.

## Usage
This project contains JSON files to dynamically render experiences and certificates content on the portfolio.

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

You can view your portfolio at http://localhost:5173/ (the default Vite server URL).
